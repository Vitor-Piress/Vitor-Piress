# ðŸ¥‡ About me
 My name is Vitor, I am 19 years old and I have been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember. Throughout my life, I have learned to appreciate problem-solving and the convenience that technology brings to all of us. As a Systems Development Technician, I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems to specialize and grow in this field that fascinates me so much. In addition, I am seeking an opportunity to start my professional career in IT, put my knowledge into practice, and continue learning along the way.
